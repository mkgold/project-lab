# Project Laboratory

We are going to work out the process for designing your digital research project in this session. Good—or shall we say effective—projects begin with a plan. It's true those plans may change over the life cycle of the project. Your questions may change. Your funding may change. Even the shape your "final" research project takes may change. 


## Learning objectives

In this workshop, you will learn the following skills:
- Identify existing resources (and maybe even a few you haven't thought of yet)
- Identify your needs
- Create a workplan 
- Find new resources
- Communicate your plan
