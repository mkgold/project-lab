# Describing your project

## Project Summary

 * Describe your project and its purpose in 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience. What are its central goals?

## What would an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) look like? 

For any digital project, there are parts of it that are absolutely necessary, and other parts that would be nice to have. Thinking about your overall project, could you divide it up into phases, where Phase 1 contains the minimum functionality that would have to be included, and other aspects of the project could be part of a Phase 2 that is completed at a later date?
 
 * What aspects of your project idea need to be part of the first release? Which could be planned for a later Phase 2 if needed?
