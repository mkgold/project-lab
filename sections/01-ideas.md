# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## What would an MVP look like? 

For any digital project, there are parts of it that are absolutely necessary, and other parts that would be nice to have. Thinking about your overall project, could you divide it up into phases, where Phase 1 contains the minimum functionality that would have to be included, and other aspects of the project could be part of a Phase 2 that is completed at a later date?

## Activity


* Now, Describe your project in 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the purpose of your project. 

 * Does it solve a problem? 
 * Meet an institutional need? 
 * Put an existing resource to new use?  
 
 * Think about the overall scope of your project. Divide it into two phases. What aspects of your ideas could potentially be postponed to a Phase 2 if needed?
