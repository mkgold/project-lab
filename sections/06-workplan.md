# Work plans: Scoping and Scheduling Your Work

Work plans describe the work to be done, the deadlines by which the work will be done, and who will do the work. 

What follows are several possible ways to organize your project's work plan. Project work plans are often organized in one of two ways: by the order of deliverables or tasks OR by calendar year. This may be determined by a grant's application deadlines, your fellowship timeline, a book or dissertation deadline, or your own arbitrary deadline. If you are applying for funding, you will want to check to see if the grant you are applying for specifies a format for the work plan.  you may want to look at examples of previous, successful grants for examples. Most federal grant agencies post vetted copies of previously awarded applications for this purpose. 

## Preliminary Questions: 
1. What is the period of performance for the project? (ie. How long do you have to complete the work?)
2. Who are the key personnel, and what is their availability? 
3. What are the resources available? 

## Major Areas of Project Work: 
**Successful work plans consider the following types of work to be completed during the life-cycle of the project.**
* Planning and Research
* Content Development (Dataset)
* Technical Development
* Design
* Evaluation
* Outreach and Publicity
* Advisory Committee/Consultation with Outside Specialists

## Activity
Using the outline below or a combination or variation of the two, begin to map out the activities that need to happen (remember to use the worksheets you have already created) in order to complete your project. You may wish to start at the end with your description of the ideal "end" and work backwards. 

## Major Deliverables: 

**Project plans that foreground the "deliverables" of the project keep the focus on what will be accomplished.**
