# Identifying Audiences, Constituencies, and Collaborators

 The "general public" is too general an audience. the more specific your audience is the more likely you are to meet their needs. 

 * Who will participate in, use, and/or benefit from the project? 
 * Is there a specific group already asking for this new project? Who? 
 * Is there anything that my audience can bring to my project?

# Use Cases

* Use cases provide a way to imagine specific types of people who might benefit from interacting with your project. Describing them in a few sentences will help you imagine how your project might be used by a potential audience.

For each use case:

* Provide a fake name
* Provide a role/institution/profession
* Describe how or why the person would come to interact with your project
* Describe how the project will benefit them

At a later point in time, or for a grant proposal, you can write up your use cases into prose. For now, just put together bullet points for three potential use cases.

## Sample Use Case (paragraph)

(text taken from a successful grant for the [Commons In A Box OpenLab](https://commonsinabox.org/) proposal submitted to the NEH:

*	Every year, the English department organizes a Literary Arts Festival designed to engage the entire college community. This year it hopes to draw in local artists, writers, and other members of the local community. Department members set up a project space where faculty, staff, and students can discuss work by the featured writers and post their contributions to the collegeâ€™s writing competition. Selected guest artists from the community join the conversation online, commenting on student entries in the competition, and fostering connections between what happens on campus and the intellectual and artistic activity that surrounds it.

* Faculty who teach 80 separate first-year writing courses at a community college want to bring their sections into dialogue with one another around common readings. Each one uses the PressForward plugin to capture content from RSS feeds, APIs, and institutional repositories related to weekly discussion topics. Using an internal nomination and commenting feature to collectively evaluate and select featured weekly readings, students and faculty share selections with peers, creating a fluid exchange of engaging, open-source content and prompting cross-section dialogue. By following the RSS feeds of other sections, students create blog entries that foster wider audiences for their own writing, prompting cross-collaboration and discussion.

* Students in a class on nineteenth-century American literature use CBOX features developed for the Digital Thoreau project at SUNY Geneseo to collaboratively annotate works by Harriet Tubman, Walt Whitman, and William Wells Brown. As they share their research and interpretations, they adjust comment privacy settings depending on whether they want their comments to be fully public or seen only by class members. These annotated texts are used by multiple professors in succeeding terms, building a collective repository of student work over time and connecting it to similar work at other institutions.  

* Rather than submit term papers only to their faculty members, students use the Social Paper tool (funded by a 2014 NEH ODH Start-Up Grant) to share their work privately with other students in the class. After receiving feedback from their peers, students publish their work publicly on their own digital portfolios and on their course websites. At the end of the semester, faculty and students use the Anthologize tool (created during a 2010 NEH ODH Summer Institute) to produce and share eBook versions of their collected essays.
